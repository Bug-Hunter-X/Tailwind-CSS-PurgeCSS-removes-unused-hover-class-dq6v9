This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js where the CSS is purged based on usage.  If you have a class that you're expecting to be included in your CSS but it's not actually used in your rendered components, Tailwind's purge process will remove it. This can lead to unexpected styling issues where elements don't render as expected. For example, a component might have a `hover` class defined in its styles that is never applied because the component is never hovered during the build process. This will remove `hover` styles, breaking the expected interaction.
